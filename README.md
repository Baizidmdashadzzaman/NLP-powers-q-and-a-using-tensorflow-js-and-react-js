I've developed a dynamic web application that leverages the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to create a sophisticated question-and-answer system. Built using TensorFlow.js and React.js, this application provides real-time, intelligent interactions, delivering accurate and contextually relevant responses to user queries.

Key Features:
Real-time Interaction: Get immediate, accurate answers to your questions.
Advanced NLP: Utilizes TensorFlow.js for natural language understanding.
Responsive UI: Built with React.js for a seamless and smooth user experience.

Scalable Design: Efficiently handles a wide range of queries.

Technology Stack:
TensorFlow.js
React.js
Node.js

Use Cases:
Educational Support: Perfect for students needing help with their studies.
Customer Service: Ideal for businesses to provide instant support.
Personal Assistant: Great for quick and efficient information retrieval.
